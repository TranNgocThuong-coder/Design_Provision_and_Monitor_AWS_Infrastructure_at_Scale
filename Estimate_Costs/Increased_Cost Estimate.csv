### Detailed Rationale for Cost Increase

1. VPN Connection:
   - Previous Cost: $457.5/month
   - Increased Cost: $842.5/month
   - Change: Increased configuration, possibly more VPN connections or subnet associations.
   - Rationale: Enhanced the VPN setup to ensure robust and secure connections, 
   accommodating higher traffic and redundancy requirements, leading to increased costs but improved reliability and performance.

2. Amazon EC2 Instances:
   - Application Servers (Private Subnets)
     - Previous Cost: $1,172.52/month
     - Increased Cost: $2,574.12/month
     - Change: Upgraded instance type from `m5a.4xlarge` to `m5ad.8xlarge`.
     - Rationale: Upgrading to a more powerful instance type improves computational capacity and performance for application servers, 
     which is critical for handling increased workloads and ensuring smooth operations.
   
   - Web Servers (Public Subnets)
     - Previous Cost: $1,172.52/month
     - Increased Cost: $3,777.16/month
     - Change: Upgraded instance type from `m5a.4xlarge` to `m5ad.12xlarge`.
     - Rationale: Similar to the application servers, this upgrade provides enhanced performance and scalability for web servers, 
     ensuring they can handle higher traffic volumes and provide better user experiences.

3. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL:
   - Previous Cost: $2,374.52/month per instance
   - Increased Cost: $5,734.72/month per instance
   - Change: Upgraded instance type from `db.m5.4xlarge` to `db.m5.8xlarge` and increased storage from 1 TB to 5 TB.
   - Rationale: Increasing the instance type and storage capacity for RDS improves database performance and storage capabilities, 
   which is essential for applications requiring large-scale data processing and storage.

4. General Optimizations:
   - Amazon CloudFront: No changes, indicating that the configuration was already optimized for cost and performance.
   - Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway: No changes, suggesting optimal usage.
   - Amazon Route 53: No changes, maintaining the same DNS setup.
   - Amazon S3: No changes, keeping the storage configuration constant.

### Summary of Changes and Impact

- Increased Computational Resources: Upgrading EC2 instances for both application and web servers significantly raises monthly costs 
  but provides better performance, scalability, and reliability.
- Enhanced Database Capacity: Upgrading RDS instance types and increasing storage supports larger data workloads and higher throughput, 
  which is vital for data-intensive applications.
- Improved VPN Setup: Increasing VPN connections or subnet associations enhances security and reliability, 
  accommodating greater network traffic and redundancy needs.

These changes ensure that the infrastructure can handle higher demands, provide better performance, and offer greater scalability, 
albeit at a higher cost. The focus is on achieving robust and reliable operations to support business growth and increased workload demands.
