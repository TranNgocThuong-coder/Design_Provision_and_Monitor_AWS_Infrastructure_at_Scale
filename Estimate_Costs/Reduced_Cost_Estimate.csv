Changes and Impact on Infrastructure

1. VPN Connection
   - Monthly Cost Reduced: From $457.5 to $347.5
   - Description: Reduced monthly cost by optimizing the usage or configuration of the VPN connections, 
   such as adjusting the number of Site-to-Site VPN Connections or reducing the number of subnet associations.
   - Impact: Slightly reduced redundancy or capacity of VPN connections.
   - Rationale: This change was implemented to ensure efficient utilization of VPN connections, 
   thereby lowering costs without compromising the necessary secure connectivity.


2. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
   - Monthly Cost Reduced: From $4,987.16 to $2,587.04 (combined)
   - Description: 
     - Initial: Two instances with a combined monthly cost of $4,987.16 (one with 100 GB storage and another with 1 TB storage, both Multi-AZ and db.m5.4xlarge).
     - Reduced: Two instances with a combined monthly cost of $2,587.04 (both with 512 GB storage, Multi-AZ, and db.m5.2xlarge).
   - Impact: 
     - Performance: Downgraded instance types from db.m5.4xlarge to db.m5.2xlarge may lead to reduced processing power and memory.
     - Storage: Reduced storage capacity may impact data storage needs.
   - Rationale: By right-sizing the database instances and storage, 
   we were able to significantly cut costs while still maintaining adequate performance and capacity. 
   This adjustment ensures that resources are not over-provisioned and aligns the database setup more closely with the actual workload demands.

3. Application Servers (Private Subnets) and Web Servers (Public Subnets) - Amazon EC2
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $1,172.52 each
   - Description: No changes made.

4. Amazon CloudFront
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $870.4
   - Description: No changes made.

5. Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $66.6
   - Description: No changes made.

6. Application Load Balancer
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $44.96
   - Description: No changes made.

7. Amazon Route 53
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $183
   - Description: No changes made.

8. S3 Standard Storage
   - Monthly Cost: Remains $23.55
   - Description: No changes made.

General Optimizations:
Rationale: In other areas, such as EC2 instances and Data Transfer, no changes were made, indicating that these were already optimized for cost and performance. 
The focus was primarily on identifying and adjusting over-provisioned resources to better match the operational requirements 
without affecting the overall performance and reliability of the system.
These changes collectively contribute to a more cost-efficient infrastructure, 
balancing the need for performance and reliability with the goal of reducing unnecessary expenses.

### Infrastructure Impact Summary

The primary changes involve the optimization of VPN connections and the downgrade of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instances. 
These changes have resulted in a significant reduction in monthly costs while potentially impacting performance and storage capacity. 
The rest of the infrastructure, including CloudFront, EC2 instances, NAT Gateway,
Application Load Balancer, Route 53, and S3 Standard storage, remains unchanged.
